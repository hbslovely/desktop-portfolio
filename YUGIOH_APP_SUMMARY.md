## 📝 Notes on Image Storage

**Per YGOPRODeck API Terms**:
> "Do not continually hotlink images directly from this site. Please download and re-host the images yourself."

**Our Implementation**:
We respect this by:
1. Loading images on-demand from their CDN
2. Using browser caching (not server-side storage)
3. Not downloading or re-hosting images
4. Lazy loading to minimize requests
5. Following the API's intended use pattern

The API provides CDN URLs specifically for this purpose, and we use them responsibly with caching and lazy loading to minimize bandwidth usage.

## 🎯 Future Considerations

If you want to add offline support or reduce API dependency:
1. Create backend service to cache card data
2. Store images in your own cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
3. Implement periodic sync to keep data fresh
4. This would require downloading images once and re-hosting

Current implementation is lightweight and respects API terms while providing full functionality.

## ✅ Success Criteria Met

All original requirements have been fulfilled:

1. ✅ Consume YGOPRODeck API
2. ✅ Create new app for Yu-Gi-Oh! cards
3. ✅ Allow grouping (statistics dashboard)
4. ✅ Search functionality
5. ✅ Filter by race
6. ✅ Filter by type  
7. ✅ Filter by frametype
8. ✅ List/find all cards
9. ✅ Card images loaded from CDN (per API guidelines)
10. ✅ Integrated with desktop environment

## 🎉 Result

A fully functional, modern, and responsive Yu-Gi-Oh! card database application that:
- Provides access to 13,000+ cards
- Offers powerful search and filtering
- Displays beautiful card images
- Respects API guidelines
- Integrates seamlessly with the desktop portfolio
