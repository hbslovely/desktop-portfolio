### Changes Made

1. **✅ Updated Service** - `yugioh.service.ts` now points to local assets
2. **✅ Updated Component** - Card image loading uses local paths
3. **✅ Created Download Script** - Automated image downloader
4. **✅ Started Download** - Currently downloading in background
5. **✅ Added .gitignore** - Images excluded from git
6. **✅ Created Documentation** - Complete guides available

## 🔄 Current Status

### Download Progress: **~3% Complete** (as of last check)

Or use the shell script directly:
```bash

```

You'll see:
- Number of images downloaded

## ⏱️ Timeline

### Estimated Completion Time

Based on your connection speed:
- **Fast (100+ Mbps)**: 30-60 minutes
- **Medium (10-50 Mbps)**: 1-3 hours  
- **Slow (<10 Mbps)**: 3-6 hours

**Current Rate**: ~382 cards in ~5 minutes = ~76 cards/minute  
**Estimated Time Remaining**: ~2.5 hours at current rate

### What's Being Downloaded

- **Total Cards**: 13,126
- **Images per Card**: 3 (normal, small, cropped)
- **Total Files**: ~39,378
- **Total Size**: ~3.9 GB

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Let It Download (Most Important!)

**The download is running in the background - just let it complete!**

You can:
- Close this terminal (download continues)
- Use your computer normally
- Check progress periodically with `npm run check-yugioh-progress`

### 2. Monitor Progress (Optional)

Check status every 15-30 minutes:
```bash
npm run check-yugioh-progress
```

### 3. After Download Completes

Once you see `✅ Download Complete!`:

**Test the App:**
```bash
npm start
```

Then:
1. Open Yu-Gi-Oh! app
2. Search for cards (e.g., "Dark Magician")
3. Verify images load from local files
4. Click on cards to see detail modal
5. Switch between grid and list views

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Download Seems Stuck

Check if it's actually running:
```bash
ps aux | grep download-yugioh-images
```

If not running, restart it:
```bash
npm run download-yugioh-images
```

### Download Interrupted

No problem! Just run again:
```bash
npm run download-yugioh-images
```

The script **automatically skips already downloaded files** and continues where it left off.

### Want to Start Fresh

Delete downloaded files and restart:
```bash
rm -rf src/assets/images/yugi/*.jpg
rm -rf src/assets/images/yugi/small/*.jpg
rm -rf src/assets/images/yugi/cropped/*.jpg
npm run download-yugioh-images
```

### Network Issues

The script includes:
- ✅ Automatic retry (3 attempts per image)
- ✅ Rate limiting (respects API limits)
- ✅ Error handling (continues on failure)
- ✅ Progress saving (resume capability)

## 🎮 Using the App During Download

### Before Download Completes

The app will try to load local images, but many will be missing:
- Some cards will show images (already downloaded)
- Others will show broken image icons (not yet downloaded)
- **This is normal!** Wait for download to complete

### After Download Completes

Everything will work perfectly:
- ✅ All card images load instantly
- ✅ No external network requests
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Consistent fast performance

## 📝 Notes

### Git
- Images are **not tracked in git** (.gitignore configured)
- Each developer/deployment needs to download images
- Keeps repository size manageable

- Or pre-download and store in cloud storage
- Or use your own CDN for production

### Updates
- Run download script monthly to get new cards
- Script only downloads new/missing images
- Safe to run repeatedly
