# File Save Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Alert with Built-in Dialog

**Problem**: The text editor was showing a browser `alert()` when a file was saved, which is not user-friendly and doesn't match the app's design.

**Solution**: Created a custom success dialog component with:
- Green check icon to indicate success
- Clean, modern design matching the app's style
- Smooth fade-in and slide-up animations
- Click-outside-to-close functionality
- Displays the full save path

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/components/apps/text-editor/text-editor.component.ts`
  - Added `showSuccessDialog` and `successMessage` signals
  - Added `closeSuccessDialog()` method
  - Replaced `alert()` call with dialog display

- `src/app/components/apps/text-editor/text-editor.component.html`
  - Added success dialog HTML markup with icon, message, and OK button

- `src/app/components/apps/text-editor/text-editor.component.scss`
  - Added styles for `.dialog-overlay` and `.success-dialog`
  - Added animations for smooth appearance

### 2. Fixed Bug: Saved Files Not Appearing in Explorer

**Problem**: Files saved from the text editor were not appearing in the Explorer app due to unreliable DOM manipulation approach.

**Solution**: Created a centralized file system service that maintains shared state across all Explorer instances:

**New File Created**:
- `src/app/services/file-system.service.ts`
  - Provides a shared signal for the file system
  - Handles adding files to the virtual file system
  - Manages localStorage for virtual file content
  - Provides helper methods for file operations

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/components/apps/explorer/explorer.component.ts`
  - Injected `FileSystemService`
  - Added effect to watch for shared file system changes
  - Updated `loadFileSystem()` to sync with the shared service

- `src/app/app.component.ts`
  - Injected `FileSystemService`
  - Simplified `onTextEditorFileSave()` to use the service
  - Removed unreliable DOM manipulation code

## How It Works

### File Saving Flow:

1. User saves a file in the Text Editor
2. Text Editor emits `onFileSave` event to parent component
3. App Component receives the event and calls `fileSystemService.addFile()`
4. FileSystemService:
   - Finds the parent folder in the file system structure
   - Creates a new file item or updates existing one
   - Stores the file content in localStorage
   - Updates the shared file system signal
5. All Explorer instances automatically receive the update via the effect hook
6. The saved file now appears in all open Explorer windows
7. Success dialog is shown to the user

## Testing the Changes

### Test 1: Success Dialog
1. Open the Text Editor app
2. Type some content
3. Click Save button
4. Navigate to a folder (e.g., Documents)
5. Enter a file name
6. Click Save
7. **Expected**: A green success dialog appears with a check icon and the save path
8. Click OK to close the dialog

### Test 2: File Appears in Explorer
1. Open the Text Editor app
2. Create and save a file to /Documents/test.html
3. Close the success dialog
4. Open the Explorer app
5. Navigate to Documents folder
6. **Expected**: The test.html file appears in the file list
7. Double-click the file to open it
8. **Expected**: The file opens with the saved content

### Test 3: File Persistence
1. Save a file as described above
2. Refresh the browser page
3. Open Explorer and navigate to the saved location
4. **Expected**: The file is still there (stored in localStorage)

### Test 4: Multiple Explorer Windows
1. Open Explorer (Window 1)
2. Open another Explorer window via start menu (Window 2)
3. In Window 1, navigate to Documents
4. In Window 2, navigate to Downloads
5. Open Text Editor and save a file to Documents
6. **Expected**: Window 1 immediately shows the new file
7. Navigate Window 2 to Documents
8. **Expected**: Window 2 also shows the new file

## Technical Benefits

1. **Reactive State Management**: Uses Angular signals for automatic UI updates
2. **Shared State**: All components access the same file system state
3. **Better User Experience**: Custom dialog matches app design
4. **Reliable**: No DOM manipulation, uses proper Angular patterns
5. **Maintainable**: Centralized file system logic in a service
6. **Testable**: Service can be easily unit tested

## Browser Compatibility

The localStorage-based virtual file system works in all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge: ✅
- Firefox: ✅
- Safari: ✅

Note: Virtual files are stored per-domain in localStorage and will persist until cleared.
